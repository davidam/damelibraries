* Introduction

Many people needs little snippets of source to make exercises and
learn a library. You can store your exercises in a repository, such
as, https://github.com/davidam/python-examples.git. It's useful, but
if the library is suffering changes or changing dependencies, perhaps
your snippets is not running.

In this project, we are experimenting a way, to store the snippets in
files to execute unit test. So, the snippets is easy to maintain.

* Install and Check tests in a Library

If you want python virtual environment

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ python3 -m venv /tmp/dl
$ cd /tmp/dl
$ source bin/activate
#+END_SRC

Now, you can install with pip

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ pip install --upgrade pip
$ pip3 install damelibraries
#+END_SRC

Checking my snippets:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ cd /tmp/dl/lib/python3.5/site-packages/damealgorithms
$ nosetests3 tests
$ cd /tmp/dl/lib/python3.5/site-packages/damejson
$ nosetests3 tests
$ cd /tmp/dl/lib/python3.5/site-packages/damepandas
$ nosetests3 tests
$ cd /tmp/dl/lib/python3.5/site-packages/damenltk
$ nosetests3 tests
$ cd /tmp/dl/lib/python3.5/site-packages/damenumpy
$ nosetests3 tests
$ cd /tmp/dl/lib/python3.5/site-packages/damescipy
$ nosetests3 tests
#+END_SRC
